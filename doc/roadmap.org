#+STARTUP: showall

* Xomax is a catalyst project
  Since Xomax is a working editor, it satisfies the condition of
  incremental development, i.e. it's always functional. That allows
  other projects to be integrated and tested on a diverse array of tasks.

** Xomax tasks
   - ability to change fonts.
   - Create side-by-side windows
   - Read emacs files in CL based emacs vertual machine
   - Bring Xomax' envirenment into allignment with the Xemacs and GNU
     Emacs 'object model'
   - Begin packages and symbols for the Xomax namespace.
   - Get QT working, even if it's in Motif.
   - Setup JIRA
   - Get the Lisp View project working.
   - Fix a shit ton of bugs.
   - Integrate with workflow tools like JIRA.
   - port Org mode to Xomax
   - Integrate slime with Xomax
   - Support Wayland and Garnet in Xomax.


** Bugs

** DONE Outlined rectagnles in modeline

   It appears as though the following code is the culprit:

   window-changed
   src/bit-screen.lisp

*** Xomax exitting

    Even when exiting with no errors Xomax doesn't shut down cleanly
    and can't be relaunched in the extist lisp image, i.e. you have to
    restart Lisp!
